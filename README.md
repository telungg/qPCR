Some codes to rearrange raw data from QuantStudio 3, so users don't need to copy paste one by one.

Data sorting for TSA-CRAFT (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2472555218823547)

TSA-CRAFT is an open source software to process Thermal Shift Assay data obtained from qPCR machines.
Here, I wrote a simple code which takes the raw data from QuantStudio 3 ("rawDataSample.xlsx") and outputs a sorted fluorescence data in the format required by TSA-CRAFT ("rawDataSampleSorted.xlsx").
